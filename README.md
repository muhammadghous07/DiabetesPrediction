I give a short discription of my project which is Diabetes Prediction.
First I used Python and its libraries such that Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib and Seaborn to import the dataset and analyze the dataset by using these libraries.
After completing the process of analyzing the dataset I used Machine Learning libraries such that Logistic Regression to predict their dataset and then check the training model accuracy.
